# OutlookCal2Todoist

The problem was the need to have Outlook appointments on mobile. Unfortunately I cant install Outlook mobile application for security reasons. That was when I decide to create a little script which helps me to copy MS Outlook calendar appointments to my Todoist.

Script get all appointments from current day + configurable days count and creates new task in special Project in Todoist (before that it deletes all tasks in that Project). Additionally is sets  special label to this tasks. Task contains Subject, Start date/time and Location information.
